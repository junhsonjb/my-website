My Personal Website
====================

Welcome to the _README.md_ of Junhson Jean-Baptiste's personal website.

This document is mainly for:
- Planning out the site
  + there'll be an outline below for that stuff
- looking pretty, as I am also learning markdown (it's pretty easy!)
  + I like it when things look nice
- yeah that's pretty much it
  + nothing to see here! \**laughs nervously then walks away*


Outline
---

What am I building this site for?
1. To get my name out there.
  - I love software, this is just a small way for me to show and express that.
2. To show my audience what I'm all about.
  - I want this site to be about me (I'm not trying to be narcissistic, I promise!). I hope to put in a blog section in addition to common information and contact details. I also hope to develop every resource that this site uses, for the sake of learning. If I use a twitter widget, I'll make it myself instead of linking into one. This way I can always grow as a developer and have a constantly growing project in addition to my others.
  - TLDR - just a site about lil old me, I'll also use it as a learning experience
3. For fun.
  - I like building things, especially on computers. And having a website is a great topic of conversation!

  Who are my audience?
  1. Really *awesome* people
  2. Potential employers
  3. Everyone that my mom shows this website off to (I hope lol!)

  First Draft
  - I have to start somewhere, so instead of talking about it, I'm gonna be about it. The first order of business is exactly what I'm doing now â€” starting with my outline. I saw a guy on YouTube start a personal site with document like this and I figured I should do the same (it was DevTips).
  - I've also looked at quite a few personal websites, either for inspiration or just because (which is usually for inspiration as well), so I'll probably make the design with some of that stuff in mind
  - To start, I just want this to be a simple website that looks beautiful (but not too crazy yet), that links to my resume (.pdf and online options), Linkedin, Social media, and the like.
  - I'll make it more beautiful later
  - Now, I have to actually start coding it

  Let's get it going!! ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
